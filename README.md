**Introduction**

This is a chess engine written in Common Lisp. It uses bitboards for move generation and a very basic eval function to evaluation positions. The alphaBeta search function is based off the one found on [Chess Programming](http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Alpha-Beta).

**To Make/Install**

There is no need to make the program. You just have to install xboard and sbcl. I have not tested this program on any other platform other than Linux. 

To install xboard and sbcl just type:

sudo apt-get intall xboard sbcl

**To run**

type

chmod 777 run

./run
